# Anxiety Flask
### Copying people is how you learn!

## What?
This is an implementation of Paul Ford's [Anxiety Box](https://github.com/ftrain/anxietybox).

## Why?
Because I'm new to flask and wanted to mess around. Specifically, I wanted to practice with SQLAlchemy.

## How?
```
./install.sh
source venv/bin/activate
python AnxietyFlask/runserver.py
```
Or [see here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/) to get it running with mod_wsgi.
